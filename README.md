# Go Perceptron

A single level perceptron classifier with weights estimated from sonar training data set using stochastic gradient descent.
The implementation is in dev. Planned features:

- cross validation testing
- [mathgl](https://github.com/go-gl/mathgl.git) for better vector space handling
- multilevel (3 and then parametric) level perceptron to resolve non-linearly separable problems
- some other cool neural model XD
